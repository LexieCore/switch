This contains the SWITCH electricity planning model written in Pyomo. 

To use it, either install this to a standard location or set the
environment variable PYTHONPATH to include this directory. The latter
option is probably more useful for developers. On mac or linux systems,
you can do this by adding the following line to your loging script
~/.profile and updating it to the actual path to your switch_py
directory. This won't work if you use a relative path to specify your
home directory. For example, "~/src/switch_py" will not work, but
"/home/username/src/switch_py" will work.

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/absolute/path/to/switch_py"

To run the tests, do:

./run_tests.py
